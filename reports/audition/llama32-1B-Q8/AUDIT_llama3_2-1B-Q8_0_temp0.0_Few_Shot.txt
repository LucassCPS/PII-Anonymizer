**Improved Medical Record Access**
=====================================

**Description:** Enhance our medical records system to allow employees to access their records via IPv6 addresses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### 1. Employees can access their medical records using their employee ID (e.g., F1957083, D-163781-H) and medical record number (e.g., L3894141).

*   The system should validate the employee ID and medical record number against the existing database.
*   If the ID and number are valid, the system should redirect the employee to their medical record page.

### 2. The system supports IPv6 addresses for employee login (e.g., b829:c0a0:2e01:44e3:457d:1401:9a57:989, 1e38:d6c2:8c43:2e42:f5a0:2683:ac39:fde3).

*   The system should validate the IPv6 address against the existing database.
*   If the address is valid, the system should redirect the employee to their medical record page.

### 3. The system verifies employee identity using their date of birth (e.g., 1961-11-15, 1910-07-13).

*   The system should validate the employee's date of birth against the existing database.
*   If the date of birth is valid, the system should redirect the employee to their medical record page.

**Implementation:**

To implement this feature, we can use the following steps:

1.  **Create a new endpoint for IPv6 login**: We can create a new endpoint that accepts IPv6 addresses as input and redirects the employee to their medical record page.
2.  **Validate employee ID and medical record number**: We can use a library like `uuid` to validate the employee ID and medical record number against the existing database.
3.  **Validate employee date of birth**: We can use a library like `date` to validate the employee's date of birth against the existing database.
4.  **Redirect employee to medical record page**: If the validation is successful, we can redirect the employee to their medical record page.

**Example Code (Python)**

import uuid
import datetime
