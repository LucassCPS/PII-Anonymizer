Raw LLM output:
## Step 1: Identify the sensitive information
The given text contains the following sensitive information:
- IPv4 address: 136.129.142.198
- Date: 1925-10-07
- Medical record number: MED46587216
- Social Security Number: 391-82-3228

## Step 2: Classify the sensitive information
Based on the categories of sensitive data provided, the identified information can be classified as follows:
- IPv4 address: geolocation (city, state, country)
- Date: personal identification number (SSN)
- Medical record number: personal identification number (SSN)
- Social Security Number: personal identification number (SSN)

## Step 3: Create the JSON response
The JSON response should contain the identified entities with their corresponding labels and exact values.

```json
{
    "entities": [
        {
            "label": "geolocation",
            "text": "136.129.142.198"

  Our backup policy ensures data is protected with regular backups. Employee Dx-68723's data is backed up daily, with a retention period of 30 days. Medical records, such as MED6090458, are backed up weekly and retained for 1 year. Credit card numbers, like 349558217415899, are encrypted and backed up daily, retained indefinitely. In case of data loss, our RTO is 4 hours, and RPO is 1 hour. Born on 1957-12-09, our IT manager oversees these procedures.

Raw LLM output:
## Step 1: Identify the potential sensitive information in the provided text.

The text contains the following potential sensitive information:
- Email addresses: nroberson@example.com, huangmelissa@example.com
- Medical record number: V6872093
- Date of birth: 2004-01-02
- Social security number: 240-88-3468

## Step 2: Determine the exact values of the identified sensitive information.

- Email addresses: nroberson@example.com, huangmelissa@example.com
- Medical record number: V6872093
- Date of birth: 2004-01-02
- Social security number: 240-88-3468

## Step 3: Identify the categories of sensitive data.

Based on the determined exact values, the categories of sensitive data are:
- Full or partial name
- Personal identification numbers (SSN, Driver’s License, Passport)
- Email, phone number
- Address or ZIP code
- Birth date or age
- Geographical location (city, state, country)
- Relatives' names (spouse, child, parent)
- Banking or legal identifiers

## Step 4: Create the structured JSON response.

```json
{
    "entities": [
        {
            "label": "email",
            "text": "nroberson@example.com"
        },
        {
            "label": "email",
            "text": "huangmelissa@example.com"
        },
        {
            "label": "ssn",
            "text": "240-88-3468"
        }
    ]
}
```

The final answer is: 
```json
{
    "entities": [
        {
            "label": "email",
            "text": "nroberson@example.com"

  Only in dataset (FN): 4
Adjusted counts → TP: 0 | FP: 0 | FN: 4

Raw LLM output:
## Step 1: Identify potential sensitive information
The provided text contains the following potential sensitive information:
- IP address 141.78.93.120
- Customer's medical record number (G9710320)
- Credit card number (3727-4303-5247-738)
- Date of birth (1949-01-06)

## Step 2: Determine the relevance of each potential sensitive information
- IP address 141.78.93.120: This could be a sensitive piece of information, but it's not directly related to the customer's personal data.
- Customer's medical record number (G9710320): This is a unique identifier for the customer's medical record, which is a sensitive piece of information.
- Credit card number (3727-4303-5247-738): This is a financial identifier, which is also a sensitive piece of information.
- Date of birth (1949-01-06): This is a personal identifier, which is a sensitive piece of information.

## Step 3: Identify the IP address as a non-sensitive piece of information
The IP address 141.78.93.120 is not directly related to the customer's personal data and is therefore not considered sensitive.

## Step 4: Return the final structured JSON response
The final JSON response will contain the identified sensitive information and the IP address as a non-sensitive piece of information.
